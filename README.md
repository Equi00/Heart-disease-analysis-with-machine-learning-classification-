# Heart Disease Analysis using Machine Learning (Classification)

## Objetives

This project aims to analyze a dataset that indicates important information about heart diseases.
The tables we have in our dataset are:
- age
- sex 
- cp (type of chest pain)
- trestbps (resting blood pressure)
- chol (serum cholesterol)
- fbs (fasting blood glucose)
- restecg (resting electrocardiogram)
- thalach (maximum heart rate achieved)
- exang (exercise-induced angina)
- oldpeak (exercise-induced ST depression relative to rest)
- slope (the slope of the ST segment at maximum exercise)
- ca (number of main vessels)
- thal (a blood disorder called thalassemia)
- target

The next objective is to see which classification model is best for predicting the "target" variable.
